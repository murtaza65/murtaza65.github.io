#Improving health outcomes using remote patient monitoring

Imagine these scenarios…

●	Here is Jane, a 65-year-old woman with high blood pressure and diabetes. Recently, she is dealing with feelings of dizziness and rapidly changing blood pressure. Her doctor suggests using a special device to monitor her health from home. The device continuously tracks her vital signs and sends data wirelessly to her doctor, who can review it in real time. This helps the doctor detect patterns, make timely adjustments to her treatment, and provide personalized care. Jane feels confident knowing her health is monitored, even at home. 

●	A second example is Jude, a 52-year-old man with a recent heart attack and bypass surgery. To ensure a successful recovery, his doctor suggests using a remote monitoring device that keeps a record of his heart and vital signs remotely. The device sends data to the medical team, who can detect any problems early and adjust his treatment if needed. Jude agrees to use the device for added support.

Remote Patient Monitoring

Remote patient monitoring (RPM), also called telemonitoring or telehealth, is a method of using technology to remotely monitor and track patients' health conditions at their homes. It involves collecting and analyzing patient data from wearable devices or sensors that measure various health parameters and is transmitted wirelessly to healthcare professionals, who can review it and provide timely interventions. RPM can also incorporate video consultations and secure messaging platforms to facilitate communication between patients and healthcare providers.

Benefits of Remote Patient Monitoring Devices in Healthcare
These are:


●	Improved safety: During the Covid-19 pandemic, healthcare providers have adopted remote patient monitoring as a way to care for patients while minimizing exposure risks. This allows doctors to provide care without in-person visits (Mecklai et al., 2021).

●	Improved Disease Management: Remote patient monitoring provides continuous tracking of patients' health data and enables healthcare providers to intervene early, adjust treatment plans, and prevent complications.

●	Reduced Hospitalizations: Detection of changes in health parameters in time allows for proactive interventions, preventing the need for emergency hospital visits.

●	Enhanced Patient Self-Management: When patients regularly track their health status, they can better understand their condition, and take necessary steps to manage their health effectively.

●	Cost Savings: Preventing hospitalizations and emergency visits reduces the financial burden on patients. Additionally, healthcare systems benefit from decreased healthcare utilization and improved resource allocation.

●	Quality of Life is Improved: Remote monitoring aid patients to receive care in the comfort of their own homes, reducing the interruption of daily activities. 

●	Early Detection of Changes: Any deviations from normal values can be quickly identified, allowing for timely interventions and preventing the progression of the disease.

●	According to Walker, Tong, Howard, and Palmer (2019), remote monitoring provides patients with a sense of security and support, leading to increased patient satisfaction and confidence in their care (Walker et al., 2019).


Health Conditions Requiring Remote Monitoring
These include the following:

Vital signs monitoring: Tracking metrics such as blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation levels.

Chronic disease management: Data such as blood glucose level, weight, or activity levels are well monitored for health conditions like diabetes, hypertension, and heart disease.

Post-operative care: Ensures proper recovery of patients after surgery by early detection of complications.

Telemedicine consultations: Conduct virtual appointments where patients and healthcare providers can interact through video calls or secure messaging platforms.


Patients who benefit from remote patient monitoring.
This can benefit a wide range of patients, particularly those with the following health challenges:

Figure 3: In the process of data flow in healthcare, the first step involves the transmission of patient data. This can be done through digital devices where patients answer health-related questions or take measurements. In the second step, the received data is evaluated either by healthcare providers or through automated assessment by a program. High-risk data is then forwarded to healthcare providers for further follow-up. The final step is a follow-up, where healthcare providers reach out to patients if any concerns are indicated by their health data. Image Source: Google Images


Chronic diseases: Patients with chronic conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, or kidney disease can benefit from RPM as continuous monitoring of their vital signs, symptoms, and medication adherence can help healthcare providers detect any changes or trends that may require intervention, leading to better management. 

Post-operative patients: Patients who are recovering from surgery can benefit as remote monitoring allows healthcare providers to assess post-operative progress, monitor vital signs, track pain levels, and identify any potential complications or adverse reactions.

Elderly patients: The aging population often faces multiple chronic conditions and may have difficulties accessing healthcare facilities. RPM ensures their safety, medication adherence, and overall well-being. It also allows for early detection of any health deterioration, falls, or changes in behavior.

Patients with complex care needs: Health challenges such as multiple chronic conditions, comorbidities, or a history of frequent hospitalizations, can benefit from RPM. 

High-risk pregnancies: Conditions like gestational diabetes, hypertension, or multiple pregnancies would require remote monitoring of blood pressure, blood glucose levels, fetal movements, and other relevant parameter. 

Mental health conditions:  Conditions such as depression, anxiety disorders, or bipolar disorder can benefit from remote tracking of their mood, sleep patterns, medication adherence, safety, and therapeutic progress.

Note that each patient's condition is to be evaluated carefully to determine if there is a need for remote patient monitoring.

Examples of Remote Patient Monitoring  Devices
Here are a few examples:

Wearable devices:  Smartwatches, fitness trackers, or patches, can continuously monitor vital signs and activity levels and can track parameters like heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, sleep patterns, and steps taken. 

Glucose monitors: This measures blood sugar levels throughout the day. Thereby, enhancing patient care.

Blood pressure monitors: The readings are recorded and transmitted to healthcare providers, who can monitor trends, adjust medications, and provide guidance on managing hypertension.

Cardiac monitors: Conditions, such as arrhythmias or heart failure, can benefit from cardiac monitors that track their heart's electrical activity. These devices can include implantable loop recorders or external cardiac event monitors that record and transmits data on the heart's rhythm and any irregularities. 

Telemedicine platforms: This enables virtual consultations between patients and healthcare providers. Through video calls or secure messaging, patients can communicate their symptoms, receive medical advice, and discuss treatment plans. These platforms may also integrate remote monitoring devices, allowing patients to share real-time data during the virtual consultation.

Remote medication adherence systems:  These systems can remind patients to take their medications at the prescribed times and track their adherence. This allows healthcare providers to intervene if non-adherence is detected.

Respiratory monitors: Conditions like asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease can use these monitors to track their lung function and symptoms. These devices measure parameters like peak flow, lung capacity, or oxygen saturation levels. The data is transmitted to healthcare providers, who can assess lung function, monitor trends, and adjust treatment plans.

Conclusion 
Remote patient monitoring is a valuable tool in healthcare that allows doctors to take care of patients from a distance and with it's numerous benefits, such as keeping patients safe during times like the COVID-19 pandemic, manage diseases better, and reducing the need for hospital visits. Wearable trackers or glucose monitors, help patients keep track of their health and share important information with their doctors. Certainly, a promising way to improve healthcare, making it more convenient and effective for patients is through the utilization of remote patient monitoring devices.
